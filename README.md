<h2> :floppy_disk: Project Files Description</h2>
We will build a random forest model to predict whether a given customer defaults or not. Credit default is one of the most important problems in the banking and risk analytics industry. There are various attributes which can be used to predict default, such as demographic data (age, income, employment status, etc.), (credit) behavioural data (past loans, payment, number of times a credit payment has been delayed by the customer etc.).
